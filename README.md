# GalleryWebsite

This is an older project I was working on for a friend.

It was a simple django based CMS. Wordpress had too many extranious features and creating a CMS from the ground up sounded like a fun challenge.

The idea was to create a simple CMS that would display his artwork and would be easy for him to update. I got it working with a few features, but it was not as fleshed out as I wanted. I got wrapped up in school, maybe one day I'll come back and finish it up.
